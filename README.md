**What is a Keylogger? – By Joshwa**
A Keylogger (short for keystroke logger) is a type of surveillance tool that records every key pressed on a keyboard. This logging is usually done discreetly, so the user is unaware their activities are being tracked.
The purpose of a keylogger is often malicious, such as stealing passwords, credit card numbers, or confidential information. However, keyloggers are also used in legitimate situations like corporate monitoring.
Even Microsoft confirmed that early versions of Windows 10 included a built-in keylogger, officially stated to "improve typing and writing functions."

**Types of Keyloggers**
Keyloggers can be categorized into two main types:

**1. Software-Based Keyloggers**
These are programs that run within an operating system and log user activity through various techniques:
Clipboard Logging: Captures any data copied to the clipboard.
Screen Logging: Takes screenshots to capture visual information.
Text Capture via Programs: Collects text from specific applications.
Internet Activity Monitoring: Logs search engine queries, chat messages, downloads, and bandwidth usage.

**2. Hardware-Based Keyloggers**
These are physical devices installed between a keyboard and a computer. Key characteristics include:
Works from Startup: Starts recording as soon as the device powers on.
No Software Installation Needed: Operates at the hardware level.
Stealth Operation: Difficult to detect through traditional antivirus.
Varied Storage: Storage sizes range from kilobytes to terabytes, with each keystroke typically using one byte of space.

**Detecting and Removing Keyloggers**
Keyloggers, especially low-quality or malware-based ones, might cause system issues such as:
Slower web browsing
Delay between typing and characters appearing
Mouse or system lag
Graphical glitches or error messages
Detection methods include:
Running a reliable antivirus or anti-malware scan
Using tools that apply:
Heuristic analysis
Signature detection
Behavioral monitoring (e.g., keystroke or screen capture patterns)
High-end commercial keyloggers may remain completely hidden and may not impact system performance. Some can even reinstall themselves after attempted removal.

**Best Practices for Staying Safe – Tips from Joshwa**
Keep your operating system and software updated
Be cautious with email attachments, even from trusted sources
Use strong, unique passwords for each account or service
Enable real-time antivirus/anti-malware protection across all devices
Regularly scan your system using trusted cybersecurity tools
